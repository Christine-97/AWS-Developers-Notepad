<h1>🌐 Route 53</h1>
<p>53 is the traditional DNS port. 🌎</p>
<p>Highly available, scalable, fully managed and authoritative DNS (i.e. the customer can update the DNS records). 🚀</p>
<p>Route 53 is a domain registrar. 🏭</p>
<p>Can check health of resources. 🏥</p>
<p>AWS provides 100% availability SLA. 💯 
	(The availability SLA is a contract between a service provider and their end-user that defines the expected level of application/database uptime and accessibility a vendor is to ensure and outlines the penalties involved (usually financial) if the agreed-upon service levels are not met.)</p>
<p>Can help route traffic for a domain by reacting records. 🚥</p>
<p>Each record contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Domain / subdomain name - example.com</li>
  <li>Record type- A / AAAA / CNAME / NS</li>
  <li>Value - xx.xx.xx.xx</li>
  <li>Routing policy - how to route / response to queries</li>
  <li>TTL - time to live (amt of time the record is cached at the DNS resolvers). ⏰</li>
</ul>
<p>Record types:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A - maps a host name to IPv4</li>
  <li>AAAA - maps a host name to IPv6</li>
  <li>CNAME - maps a host name to another host name</li>
  <li>NS - name servers for the hosted zone (control how traffic is routed for a domain)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hosted Zones:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A directory of records and how to navigate traffic to a domain and its subdomain.</li>
  <li>Public hosted zone - contains records to route public domain names. 🌐</li>
  <li>Private hosted zone - contains records to route private domain names (within one or more VPC). 🔒</li>
</ul>

<h1>Route 53 Routing Types</h1>
<h3>I. SIMPLE 🛣️</h3>
<p>Route to a single resource. 💾<br>
Multiple values can be specified in the same record. 📝<br>
No health checks. 🚫<br>
An alias can be enabled only for 1 AWS resource. 🆔</p>

<h3>II. WEIGHTED ⚖️</h3>
<p>% of the request is routed to a specific resource. 📈<br>
Relative weights are assigned to each record: ⚖️<br><br>
<code>Traffic (%) = weight for a specific record / Sum of all weights for all records</code><br><br>
Weight doesn't need to sum up to 100. 🤝<br>
Can have health checks. 🩺<br>
DNS records must have the same name and record type. 📝<br>
Use case: can be used to test updated versions by sending small traffic to a given resource. 🧪<br>
If the weight is 0, no traffic is sent to the given record. 🚫<br>
If all weights are 0, traffic will be equally distributed. ↔️</p>

<h3>III. LATENCY ⏱️</h3>
<p>Can do health checks (has failover capability). 🩺<br>
Latency is based on the user and AWS regions ⌛<br>
Redirects to the resources closest to the user. 🌎<br>
Use case: When latency for the user is a priority ⚠️<br>
Mention the region in the record details 📍</p>

<h3>IV. FAILOVER ☠️</h3>
<p>There are 2 EC2 instances primary and secondary 🎭<br>
The Route 53 policy helps move traffic to the second instance when the primary one is deemed unhealthy. 🚨<br>
There can only be one primary and one secondary. 1️⃣ 2️⃣</p>

<h3>V. GEOLOCATION 🌍</h3>
<p>It is different from latency-based. ⏱️<br>
Routing is based on geolocation 📍<br>
Can redirect users based on content and/or country (if it overlaps, the most precise location is selected) 🌐<br>
Default locations can be set for undefined traffic. 📊<br>
Health checks can be done. 🩺<br>
Use case: Restricted content distribution, website localization 🌐</p>

<h3>VI. MULTI-VALUE 🔀</h3>
<p>Route traffic to multiple resources. 🔀<br>
Route 53 returns multiple values/resources. 🔝<br>
Health checks return only healthy resources as values. 🩺<br>
You can return up to 8 health check records for each multi-value query. 8️⃣<br>
It is not a substitute for ELB (client-side load balancing). 🚫</p>

<h3>VII. GEOPROXIMITY (Using Route 53 traffic flow feature) 🌎</h3>
<p>Allows you to route traffic to your resources based on the user's location and the resources 🌍</p>
<p>There is a number called bias, used to shift traffic to resources based on a specific location. 📍</p>
<p>To change the geographic region size, you can specify bias values: 🧭</p>
<ul>
    <li>Expand (1 to 99) - more traffic to the resource 🔝</li>
    <li>Shrink (-1 to -99) - less traffic to the resource 🔽</li>
</ul>
<p>Resources can be own resources (on-premises) hence the latitude and longitude must be specified 📍</p>
<p>For AWS resources, a region must be specified. 🌍</p>
<p>Use case: To shift traffic from one region to another. 🛣️</p>

<h1>Features</h1>
<p>Traffic flow 🚦:</p>
<ul>
<li>It simplifies the process of creating and maintaining records in large and complex configurations 🧐</li>
<li>This is a visual editor to manage complex routing decision 🎨</li>
<li>These configurations can be saved as a Traffic Flow Policy 📝</li>
<li>This can be applied to different hosting zones ( different domain names) 🌐</li>
<li>And it supports versioning 🔄</li>
</ul>
<p>Health checks ❤️‍🩹:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health checks are integrated with Cloud Watch metrics 🔍 -</li>
<li>I. Endpoint 📍:</li>
<ul>
<li>15 global health checkers check the endpoint.</li>
<li>Healthy/Unhealthy threshold can be set.</li>
<li>A 30-second or 10-second interval ($$$) can be set for health checks to be done.</li>
<li>HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP are supported.</li>
<li>&gt; 18% health checker must report the end port to be healthy</li>
<li>You can also choose which locations you want Route 53 to use</li>
<li>Health Checks pass only if it responds to 2xx and 3xx status codes.</li>
<li>Health Checkers IP range must be configured to allow incoming requests.</li>
</ul>
<li>II. Calculated Health Checks (Health checks to check other health checks) 🤔:</li>
<ul>
<li>Combine multiple child health checks with parent health checks.</li>
<li>combination of AND OR or NOT can be used.</li>
<li>256 Child health checks can be monitored, and the threshold to pass can be defined for the parent to pass.</li>
<li>Use case: to maintain a website without failing all health checks</li>
</ul>
<li>III. CloudWatch metrics with assigned CloudWatch Alarms 🔔:</li>
<ul>
<li>Used to maintain private resources (as private endpoints can't be accessed)</li>
<li>Create a Cloud Watch metric and create cloud watch alarms assigned to the Health Checker.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<h1>Additional information:</h1>	
<p>🤔 What is a record TTL?</p>
<p>🔍 Once the client makes a DNS request for a given hostname, the client will have to query the DNS system for a given TTL (<span>⏰</span> TIME TO LIVE - i.e. duration), as the answer has been cached for accessing the same hostname.</p>
<p>👉 High TTL</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Less traffic on Route 53</li>
<li>2 Possibly outdated records</li>
</ul>
<p>👉 Low TTL</p>
<ul>
<li>1 More traffic on Route 53, increase in cost ($$)</li>
<li>2 Records are outdated for a short time</li>
<li>3 Easy to change the record name as it is cached for a short time in the client system.</li>
</ul>
<p>🔐 TTL is mandated for each DNS record, except Alias records.</p>
<p>🚀 AWS Resources exposes AWS hostnames via load balancers, CloudFront etc</p>
<p>🔗 CNAME</p>
<p>CNAME allows you to point one hostname to another hostname ( only for non-root domains )</p>
<p>🎯 ALIAS</p>
<p>ALIAS allows you to point one hostname to AWS resources ( Both root domain and non-root domain ) 🆓 Free of charge 🏥 Can do a health check on resources</p>
<p>🌐 It can be used for (Zone apex) the top node of the DNS namespace</p>
<p>📝 Record name type A/AAAA is used for AWS resources (IPv4/IPv6)</p>
<p>👨‍💼 Route 53 will set TTL.</p>
<p>👎 EC2 DNS names cannot be targeted for ALIAS records</p>
