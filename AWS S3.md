  <p>📦 AWS S3 offers different storage classes to meet various performance, durability, and cost requirements:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Standard (🌟): This is the default storage class with high durability, availability, and performance for frequently accessed data.</li>
    <li>Intelligent-Tiering (🧠📈): This storage class automatically moves objects between two access tiers based on changing access patterns, optimizing costs and performance.</li>
    <li>Standard-Infrequent Access (🌟🔜👁️): Similar to Standard but designed for infrequently accessed data with lower storage costs and retrieval fees.</li>
    <li>One Zone-Infrequent Access (1️⃣🗺️🔜👁️): This class stores data in a single availability zone and is ideal for infrequently accessed data that can be recreated if lost.</li>
    <li>Glacier (🏔️❄️): This is a low-cost, archival storage class for data that is rarely accessed and can tolerate longer retrieval times.</li>
    <li>Glacier Deep Archive (🏔️❄️🕳️): This is the lowest-cost storage class for long-term archival data that may never be accessed again.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Each storage class has its own pricing structure and features, allowing you to choose the best fit for your data storage needs.</p>
